My name is Virginia, but I go by Ginni. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt University. Before Vanderbilt, I received my Bachelor of Science in Psychology and my Master of Science in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience from The University of Texas at Dallas. My research is focused on developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that are more aligned with human face recognition. My approach includes psychophysics, functional neuroimaging, and convolutional neural networks (though I plan to explore more models!). 

My work is grounded in a core tenet of cognitive science: that the secrets of the mind and brain can be unlocked through reverse engineering. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have created unprecedented opportunities to test this idea. We now have models sophisticated enough to investigate the mechanisms and representations that shape how we experience the world. My goal is to use computational modeling to deepen our understanding of how the human brain processes and makes sense of visual information.
